## FlareRed 
Your trusted safety companion for solo women travelers.

## Inspiration
As women of this world — as humans — we wish to travel freely, without the fear of becoming victims of assault or threat. However, that is not always the case.

As the number of women travelers increases, so do the disturbing cases of sexual assault and harassment. Statistics show that 2 in 5 women reported being sexually assaulted while traveling alone. A 2021 survey stated that 88% of women traveling solo had felt unsafe due to their surroundings, and 12% had been physically attacked or threatened. Even more alarming is the fact that female travelers are more likely to be targeted for opportunistic crimes, kidnappings, or attacks.

Our team wanted to develop an application that connects traveling women to their trusted contacts — to help them travel more safely and with less fear.

## What It Does
FlareRed is an intuitive safety app designed for women travelers. By syncing with a user’s phone contacts, it allows the creation of a safety network of trusted emergency contacts. With a single button press, users can activate a "flare" — an emergency alert — which sends a secure, private link to their real-time location to the selected safety network.
